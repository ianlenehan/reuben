          Well done on making it here Reuben! I expect you to settle into this
          world and spend quite a bit of time getting to know it before you even
          have any idea of what the internet might be. I can imagine everything
          is a bit overwhelming for you at the moment. I'm excited for you
          though, because you have no idea what awaits you out in the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet is like the world, there is some amazing stuff on the
          internet and some bad stuff. Try to stay away from the bad stuff, but
          here's your opportunity to make good stuff on the internet. One day,
          you might like your own website, with your own name as the web
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well here it is. I will hold this domain name and website for you
          until you're ready to do someting with it. At which point it will be
          your own private little space on the internet.
